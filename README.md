# Visual-effects-of-depths
Creating visual effects for a game underwater world.

This project deals with creating a realistic underwater environment.
Let's make a small plan.
1) Particle systems:
- bubbles
- shoals
- jellyfish
2) It's dark underwater, add glowing plankton/fluorescent jellyfish
3) The "Radiance" consists of parts and it depends on the waves
- the rays of light are directly under the surface of the water
- caustics on objects


The main ideas of the particle system for bubbles:
An emission source is a place where bubbles appear (for example, a point at the bottom of a reservoir).
Particles (bubbles) are objects (or visual elements) that rise up, decreasing and disappearing over time.
The behavior of particles is upward movement, vibrations, size, transparency, speed, lifetime.
Visual effects â€” transparency, lighting, reflections, maybe a little shine for realism.
