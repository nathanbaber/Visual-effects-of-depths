# Visual-effects-of-depths
Creating visual effects for a game underwater world.

This project deals with creating a realistic underwater environment.
Let's make a small plan.
1) Particle systems:
- shoals
- jellyfish
2) It's dark underwater, add glowing plankton/fluorescent jellyfish
3) The "Radiance" consists of parts and it depends on the waves
- the rays of light are directly under the surface of the water
- caustics on objects
